The "Fake PNG" struggle is real. 

We've all been there: You ask the AI for a transparent background, and it literally paints a gray-and-white grid behind your character. Thanks, but no thanks.

## Why it happens

The AI isn't trying to trick you! It just saw so many stock photos with checkerboards during training that it thinks the grid = transparency.

## How to stop it

**PRO TIP:** Stop using the word "transparent" in your prompts!

Instead, prompt for **"Isolated on a solid white background."** It's much easier for the AI to understand, and way easier for you to remove with one click in Canva or Photoshop later.
